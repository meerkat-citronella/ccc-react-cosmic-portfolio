This is my developer template

It's built with create-react-app, Cosmic JS (a GraphQL CMS), and Chart JS for making charts.

I borrowed some of the techniques used in this (CosmicJS Blog Post)[https://www.cosmicjs.com/articles/building-a-developer-portfolio-with-react-cosmic-js-and-semantic-ui-jgzleiom] and also David Castenada's dev portfolio[https://hireanalf.com/]

Hosting: hover.com
Deploy: Firebase
Frontend: React
Backend: Cosmic JS

Instructions:
'npm run build' to build to 'public' folder,
'npm run start' to spin up locally,
'firebase serve --only hosting' to see what you have,
'firebase deploy' to deploy newest version to Firebase, which automatically deploys to Hover url,
