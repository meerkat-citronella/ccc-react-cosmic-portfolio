This is my developer template

It's built with create-react-app, Cosmic JS (a GraphQL CMS), and Chart JS for making charts.

I borrowed some of the techniques used in this (CosmicJS Blog Post)[https://www.cosmicjs.com/articles/building-a-developer-portfolio-with-react-cosmic-js-and-semantic-ui-jgzleiom] and also David Castenada's dev portfolio[hireanalf.com]
